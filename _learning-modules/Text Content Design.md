#### About the module
This module discusses the importance of proper text formatting and practices, such as using text hierarchies, paragraphs, and lists.

#### Importance of text content design
Besides the homepage, other pages on Isomer mainly displays text content through the markdown editor. The markdown editor allows users to format texts through elements like lists, headings, and bolding. 

Although these pages mainly handle only text content, how these texts are structured can heavily impact content readability and user experience. Contrary to what most people think, most users only do a quick scan across the page to read texts that are relevant to them. 

Comparing both examples below, you can see how a webpage formatted with proper headings and paragraphs is much easier to read than one containing just text.
