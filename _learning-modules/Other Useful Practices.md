#### About the module

This module goes through other important practices to take note of when managing your website.

 
#### Useful Practices

**Perform regular website housekeeping**

Update your website frequently with new information. Ensure that outdated content (e.g. past events or announcements) is updated or removed. Leaving irrelevant and outdated information may give users the perception that the website is unreliable.

Identify and repair broken links. Make use of free online tools available online to help you track broken links on your website.

**Account for users across different devices**

Ensure that your website works well on other devices as well. For example, mobile devices have a much smaller screen size causing certain elements of the website to be displayed differently.

Use the inspect element function to see how your website looks on other devices.

*   Go to your website
*   Right-click and select “Inspect”
*   Change device previews on the top left dropdown
