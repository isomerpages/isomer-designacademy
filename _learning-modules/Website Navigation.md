#### Structuring your website ### 


Once your website content has been planned, it is necessary to consider how properly structure them as it affects how easily users can navigate through the site and their overall user experience.

Key principles to take note of:

*   **Simplicity** - Navigation on your website should be intuitive and easy to understand.
*   **Clearly defined** - Avoid making users guess what a navigation header means or what pages may be in it.
*   **Consistency** - Labelling or categorising of information should be the similar across different folders or pages.

Pages and folders should follow a clear hierarchy with lower-level pages grouped into broader categories.

### Utilising the navigation bar ### 
The navigation bar is a key element of every website as it is the element that users rely on most to get around the site. Thus, it is important to structure its headers well.

**Place high level headers in the navigation bar**   
Keeping high level headers accessible gives users a broad overview of where to go. Lower level headers can be placed in the dropdown menu instead. This allows pages to be better structured in a logical and intuitive manner.

**Good examples of how navigation bars are structured:**

**Avoid having too many headers**   
Excessive headers makes it more difficult for users to know where to click on. Ensure that top level headers placed are clear and meaningful!

**Keep headers clear and distinct**   
Ensure that headers do not overlap so users do not get confused on where to click. For example, avoid having headers like events and activities together as they are quite similar.

**Additional tips**   
*   A “home” category is unnecessary. Users understand that clicking on the logo goes to the homepage.
*   Keep top navigation headers for content categories. Content like user personas (e.g. parents, students, teachers) can be placed in highlights.
