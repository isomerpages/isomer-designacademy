#### About the module

This module touches on the importance of a website homepage, examples of good website homepages, and best homepage practices.

#### Importance of a homepage #### 
The homepage of your website is likely where most of your users would land first. Their experience on the homepage plays a pivotal role in capturing their attention and engaging them to continue browsing the site. 

If you think about your website as a store, your homepage is the storefront window where key items are highlighted for customers to see. Items displayed on the storefront capture the customer’s attention and determine whether they continue to take a look inside or walk away. 

Similarly, the homepage is used to introduce useful content (e.g. announcements, events) and lead users to other pages across the site. The homepage should be frequently updated with new features and updates, like how a storefront constantly shows new deals or seasonal items. Wouldn’t it be boring if people always come back to the same content?

#### How to make your homepage engaging? #### 
From hero banners to infopic sections, Isomer features a variety of homepage templates for users to customise their content. Effective use of images and copywriting also play a key part in making your website stand out. 

Take a look at how these Isomer sites make full use of their homepages:

A common theme surrounding these examples is how they make use of concise copy and relevant images to give users a glimpse into their organisations. Visually captivating hero banners are used to engage audiences right from the start. 

Each organisation has a different approach to creating its website. Some use colorful, vivid graphics to convey their identity, while others use immersive, realistic photos to showcase what they do. Even with Isomer’s standard templates, each website managed to craft a unique look that strongly represents its organisation.

#### Key principles to create an effective homepage #### 

**Use images and videos for effective storytelling**
- Incorporate visual content such as photos and videos to engage audiences and convey your message. Pair it with relevant copywriting to make your content more interesting and relatable, while showcasing your organisation’s identity.

**Help users familiarise themselves**
- Ensure that your homepage provides an overview of your website and allows users to navigate to where they need. Categories in the navigation bar and instructions on the homepage should be clear, concise, and intuitive for users.

**Keep it updated and fresh**
- Frequently update your homepage with new announcements, events, and pictures. Engage users with updates on the latest happenings in your organisation (e.g. events). This informs users that the website is constantly updated, encouraging them to check in often.

#### Best homepage practices #### 

**1. Fully utilise the homepage**

Your homepage is more than just the hero banner! Be sure to make use of different homepage sections to convey information creatively.

Make use of features like hero banner highlights, resources section, or even adding videos in the infopic section to provide more variety to your content. 

Take a look at how websites like [greenplan.gov.sg](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/) and [vaccine.gov.sg](https://www.vaccine.gov.sg/) make full use of different sections to create and customise informative homepages.

However, keep in mind that placing too many sections (more than 10) could make your homepage too long.


**2. Focus on the key information**

Refrain from over-cluttering your homepage with information. Having excessive or irrelevant information impedes users from finding what they need.

Instead, highlight what you want to say with a short, concise copy in each homepage section. Save longer details for a separate page instead.

The example below shows how Singapore Prison Service uses a short copy to introduce the Yellow Ribbon project on its homepage, with a separate link for users to find out more if they are interested.
