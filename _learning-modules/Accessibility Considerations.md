#### About the module #### 
This module explains the importance of accessibility and provides key practices to follow to ensure that your website remains accessible to all users.


#### What is accessibility? ####
Accessibility is the practice to make a product or service usable and meaningful to as many people as possible, in whichever ways they encounter it.

Think about it this way, if you have a physical store, you would want to ensure that customers using mobility devices like wheelchairs can enter and browse easily on their own. As much as possible, their experience should not be limited due to their disability.

This idea of accessibility should apply to your website as well. Whether it is making information simple for new users to understand, or including captions in videos for hearing-impaired users, we want to make sure that all users easily use our websites.

#### Why should we care about accessibility? ####
As government organisations designing websites for citizens, we have to ensure that none of our users are left behind, as these platforms are an important source of official information that many of them rely on. Our websites should be accessible to everyone, regardless of age, technological literacy, or physical abilities.
