#### **What is Isomer Design Academy?** ####
Isomer Design Academy is an educational platform consisting of learning modules to help users create better websites through Isomer. 

Through the team’s experiences working with stakeholders such as government organisations, schools, and parents, we gathered deeper insights into the challenges they face in both creating and using Isomer websites. 

Thus, we hope to create a platform that can make use of our knowledge in this area, as well as our expertise in product design, to provide Isomer users with useful website practices.

  

#### **Empowering our users** ####

Most people want to build “good” websites but often find it difficult to pinpoint where and what they need to focus on. With Isomer Design Academy, we hope to help our users better understand the elements behind a “good” website and empower them to create websites that can effectively serve their needs.

From homepage design to accessibility practices, a series of learning modules are available to help users make full use of the Isomer template. Modules are made to be easy to follow and understand, ensuring that any Isomer user can apply what they have learned.

  

#### **Go further with better websites** ####

Building well-structured websites with a focus on good user experience allows you to:



**1. Get more out of your website**

- Beyond just being a front for your organisation, your website is an important platform for users to carry out key tasks such as finding specific information or registering for an event. 

- Having a well-structured website allows these users to accomplish what they need with ease, improving key metrics like conversion rate and time spent. It is an effective and cost-efficient way for organisations to convert users.

- Conversely, a frustrating experience leads to lower user engagement and increased drop-offs on the website.

  

**2.  Reach out to every user**
    
- As much as possible, all websites should be accessible. This means that all potential users, including those with disabilities, impairments, or other limitations, should be able to use your website with ease.

- By failing to consider accessibility factors, many websites miss out on opportunities to fully reach out to all potential users. Making your websites fully accessible can prove quite impactful, especially if it is important to a large portion of your users, e.g. older users who have trouble reading small texts.

  

**3.  Convey a sense of credibility**
    
- Many users rely on an organisation’s website as a source of reliable information. Having websites with broken links, typo errors, or misplaced content not only affects user experience but also influences the perceived credibility of your site. Such experiences can lead users to assume that the website is outdated, facing technical issues, or worse, not legitimate.
