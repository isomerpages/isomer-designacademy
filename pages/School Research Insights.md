#### About this section
This section contains specific research insights that are more relevant toward schools that are using Isomer.

#### Our Research for Schools

Over the past few months, the Isomer team has worked closely with both parents & school staff to learn more about their experiences with different school websites.

Through our research, the team uncovered many useful insights that we hope to convey to schools about the challenges that their users face. The following details the different research that the team has conducted.

**Parent interviews**

Conducted 20 interviews with parents to hear their thoughts, challenges, and experiences interacting with various school websites. Parents were asked key questions such as:
   - What do you use the school website for?
   - What are some difficulties faced on school websites?
   - What do you prioritise in a school website?
    
		
**School co-creation workshop**

Hosted workshops for schools to co-create new Isomer ideas and templates with them. The team also went through a short lesson on good website practices with participants. Key observations from the workshop include:

*   Participants found the lesson on good website practices to be useful.
    
*   Noticed certain misconceptions and bad website practices by participants.


####  Key Research Insight

**Role of the school website for users:**

*   To be a source of reliable information they can trust.  
*   To be a source of relevant and updated information for the latest happenings.
*   To get a feel of the school’s culture, identity, and offerings.
    

**What type of information do users look for on school websites?**

*   Timely information (latest news, announcements, upcoming events)
*   Operational information (opening hours, contact info, important links)
*   School’s value proposition information (CCAs, school values/mission, offerings)
    

  

**Challenges faced on school websites:**

*   Key homepage elements (e.g. navigation bar or buttons) are not shown clearly.
*   Users may also miss out on important content hidden behind sliders or dropdown menus. This makes the website difficult to use as information feels inaccessible and users have to put in more effort to get what they need.
