To create an effective website, it is important to first plan on the type of content you need to have. This can be narrowed down to three main factors:

*   Who is your main audience?
  
    *   Is your website meant for current students, parents or general audiences? Remember that different groups of people will want to look at different types of content.
*   What is the objective of your website?
    
    *   Identify the needs of your audience to keep website content concise and relevant. Take note of your websiteâ€™s objectives compared to other platforms like social media.
*   What do you want visitors to focus on/what do you want to highlight?
    
    *   Once your website objective has been identified, think about how you can translate that into content on the website. Do note that having too much information would hinder users from finding whats important.
