Thank you for indicating your interest to be part of Isomerâ€™s design workshop together with schools! You can sign up for a workshop slot at the bottom of this message.

**Why are we running this workshop?** The Isomer team would like to hear directly from schools about what is most important to you when designing and using a school website. Our end goal is always to help users build good websites, but in order to do that, we need to understand what makes a website good.&nbsp;In this session, participants can expect to:

*   Learn about current challenges from parents and students when using school websites
*   Ideate together on what makes a good school website
*   Apply learnings to reimagine a school website landing page
