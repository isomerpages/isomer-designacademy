### Our Research

Over the past few months, the Isomer team has worked closely with both parents & schools to learn more about their experiences with school websites. Through our research, the team uncovered many useful insights that we hope to convey to our users to help them create more effective Isomer sites.

**Parent interviews**   
Conducted 20 interviews with parents to hear their thoughts, challenges, and experiences interacting with various school websites.

We asked parents key questions such as:

*   What do you use the school website for?
*   What are some difficulties faced on school websites?
*   What do you prioritise in a school website?

**School co-creation workshop**   
Hosted workshops for schools to co-create new Isomer ideas and templates with them. The team also went through a short lesson on good website practices with participants.

Our observations from the workshop:

*   Participants found the lesson on good website practices to be useful.
*   Noticed certain misconceptions and bad website practices by participants.


### Key research insights

**What are users looking for on school websites?**

*   Timely information (latest news, announcements, upcoming events)
*   Operational information (opening hours, contact info, important links)
*   School offering information (CCAs, school values/mission, offerings)

**Challenges faced on school websites:**

*   Excessive information on the homepage. Not sure what to focus on.
*   The information feels inaccessible. Users have to put in a lot of work to get what they need.
*   Difficulty in navigating through the website. Users are unsure of where to click to get what they need.
*   Information is outdated and irrelevant

**What users value in school websites:**

*   Ease of use and convenience.
Users value information that is available and upfront. High-level information can be easily found on the homepage. They want to be able to quickly scan for information.

*   Well-structured navigation. Users value clear navigation headers which help them to navigate across the site easily.

*   Relevant content. Users value information that is relevant and useful to them. Having excessive, duplicated, or outdated information does not help them.

*   Engaging & visual content. Users value pictures and graphics that can give them a better sense of the school environment and culture.

**Role of the school website for users:**

*   To be a source of reliable information they can trust.
*   To be a source of relevant and updated information for the latest happenings.
*   To get a feel of the schoolâ€™s culture, identity, and offerings.

### Other insights ### 
**Pop-ups are not user-friendly**

*   Pop-ups are intrusive to users, especially if the content is outdated or irrelevant.
*   In some cases, pop-ups re-appear each time the user enters the site, making them repeatedly close it.

**Parents do use other platforms as well, such as:**

*   Social media platforms - to view photos and albums from the latest events.
*   Parents gateway - to get more important and private announcements
