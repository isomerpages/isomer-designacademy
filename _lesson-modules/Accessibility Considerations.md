Using alt-text for images

*   Ensure that all non-text items have a text alternative so that visually-impaired users can understand them through a screen reader.
*   For example, all your images should have an alt-text describing them.

Ensure proper color contrast

*   Ensure that the site colors selected have sufficient contrast against the texts. Likewise, any text in pictures or videos should also follow the same guidelines.
*   (Give a picture example)
*   Color contrast is important as it greatly impacts the readability of your site, more so for visually impaired users.

Avoid flashing content

*   Take note that uploading media with multiple flashes or rapid colors may cause seizures and be uncomfortable to view.

Make your content easily readable

*   The written content should be understandable by as many readers as possible. Avoid technical jargon or highly-contextual information as new readers might not understand them.
*   Break large chunks of texts into smaller paragraphs and sentences for easy reading.

Organise content using heading hierarchies

*   As covered in page content design, setting proper heading hierarchies and text sections improves readability and overall accessibility.
*   More importantly, such considerations dramatically enhance the experience of those relying on assistive technology. For example, headings can help screen readers better interpret your content.

Text alternatives for videos and podcasts

*   Provide in-sync captioning to videos and transcripts to audio podcasts on your site. This provides visual access to content that relies heavily on audio.
