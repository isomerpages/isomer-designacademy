### Importance of a homepage ### 
A homepage is the first thing that visitors would see. It affects their initial impression of your brand or website and plays an important role in engaging your audiences.

More importantly, it is also the page they use to navigate to other parts of your website. Thus, it is important that a homepage should not only be engaging and relevant but also clear and easy to navigate.

Your homepage is akin to your storefront, be sure to highlight key items that you would want your audience to immediately know.

### Designing the homepage ### 
Isomer features a variety of homepage templates for users to customise how they portray their content. Effective use of images, copywriting and structure can make your website stand out. Here are some good examples of how customisable Isomer sites can be.

Key principles for the homepage:

*   Keep it engaging and visual
*   Content should be easily readable
*   Helps users navigate across the site

### Good homepage practices ###


**Focus on the key information**
*   Refrain from over-cluttering the homepage with information. Emphasise the subject with a short copy and keep longer details on a separate page instead.
*   The information available on the homepage should help users get to where they need.

The example below shows how Singapore Prison Service uses concise copy to introduce different projects on its homepage.

**Creating an effective hero banner**

*   Another key aspect of every homepage is the hero banner, as it is the first thing that most people would see. An impactful hero banner image has the ability to inform viewers about your products, services, and mission at a glance.
*   Avoid low-quality images that would look blurry in bigger dimensions.
*   \[example\]
*   Do note that hero banner images have a default dark overlay when uploaded to maintain proper color contrast that adheres to accessibility standards.
*   Keep your hero banner images engaging, relevant, and clear. Use images or colors that strongly represent your brand or values. Make sure both the image and copy are closely aligned with what you want to convey.

In this example, we can see how SGTogether uses vibrant, cheerful images of citizens working together to convey a sense of partnership and support.

_Use more images_

*   Good use of images helps make your site easier to read as it breaks up and provides complimentary visual content for your texts.
*   Images used should be:
    *   Relevant to your content
    *   High-quality and not blurry
    *   Consistent across the page

_Use effective copywriting_

*   Create copies that are both functional and engaging to get your audience's attention. Make full use of your title texts to highlight key details or value propositions you want to convey.
*   Think about using more creative copies that relate to your brand/organisation. For example:
    *   About us –> OGP Approach
    *   Our values —> OGP Values

_Make full use of the homepage templates_

*   Fully utilise your homepage by using the different templates available to creatively convey information.
*   Infopics can be used to pair your information with effective images.
    *   (give examples)

_Descriptive names for buttons and links_

*   Make buttons or text links more effective by using descriptive and unique names. For example, using “Learn More” or “Our Approach” rather than just “Click Here”.
*   This provides a relevant Call-to-Action while allowing users to better know what to expect when clicking on it.
*   Descriptive names are also important for those using screen readers, as they provide context describing where the link leads to.
