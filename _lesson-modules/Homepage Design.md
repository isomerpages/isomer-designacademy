### Importance of a homepage ### 
A homepage is the first thing that visitors would see. It affects their initial impression of your brand or website and plays an important role in engaging your audiences.

More importantly, it is also the page they use to navigate to other parts of your website. Thus, it is important that a homepage should not only be engaging and relevant but also clear and easy to navigate.

Your homepage is akin to your storefront, be sure to highlight key items that you would want your audience to immediately know.

### Designing the homepage ### 
Isomer features a variety of homepage templates for users to customise how they portray their content. Effective use of images, copywriting and structure can make your website stand out. Here are some good examples of how customisable Isomer sites can be.

Key principles for the homepage:

*   Keep it engaging and visual
*   Content should be easily readable
*   Helps users navigate across the site

### Good homepage practices ###


**Focus on the key information**
*   Refrain from over-cluttering the homepage with information. Emphasise the subject with a short copy and keep longer details on a separate page instead.
*   The information available on the homepage should help users get to where they need.

The example below shows how Singapore Prison Service uses concise copy to introduce different projects on its homepage.

**Creating an effective hero banner**

*   Another key aspect of every homepage is the hero banner, as it is the first thing that most people would see. An impactful hero banner image has the ability to inform viewers about your products, services, and mission at a glance.
*   Avoid low-quality images that would look blurry in bigger dimensions.
*   \[example\]
*   Do note that hero banner images have a default dark overlay when uploaded to maintain proper color contrast that adheres to accessibility standards.
*   Keep your hero banner images engaging, relevant, and clear. Use images or colors that strongly represent your brand or values. Make sure both the image and copy are closely aligned with what you want to convey.

In this example, SGTogether uses vibrant, cheerful images of citizens working together to convey a sense of partnership and support.

**Placing effective images**

*   Adding images helps improves site readability as it breaks up and provides complimenting visuals to your texts.
*   Avoid low-quality images that may look pixelated in larger dimensions.
*   The style of images should remain consistent across the page. For example, all graphics used should follow a consistent pattern or color palette.
*   Use relevant images to aid and provide better context for your content.

**Using effective copywriting**

*   Create copies that are both functional and engaging to get your audience's attention. Make full use of your title texts to highlight key details or value propositions you want to convey.
*   Think about using creative copies that can further incorporate your brand identity.
*   For example, using the OGP approach instead of our approach, or using the OGP values instead of our values. \[image\]

**Fully utilising the homepage**

*   Your homepage is more than just the hero banner! Make full use of different homepage templates to creatively convey information.

**Descriptive names for buttons and links**

*   Make buttons or text links more effective by using descriptive and unique names. For example, using “Learn More” or “Our Approach” rather than just “Click Here”.
*   This provides a relevant Call-to-Action while allowing users to better know what to expect when clicking on it.
*   Descriptive names are also important for those using screen readers, as they provide context describing where the link leads to.
