### Importance of a homepage ### 
A homepage is the first thing that visitors would see. It affects their initial impression of your brand or website and plays an important role in engaging your audiences.

More importantly, it is also the page they use to navigate to other parts of your website. Thus, it is important that a homepage should not only be engaging and relevant but also clear and easy to navigate.

Your homepage is akin to your storefront, be sure to highlight key items that you would want your audience to immediately know.

### Designing the homepage ### 
Isomer features a variety of homepage templates for users to customise how they portray their content.

Effective use of images, copywriting and structure can make your website stand out. Here are some good examples of how customisable Isomer sites can be.

Key principles for the homepage:

*   Keep it engaging and visual
*   Content should be easily readable
*   Helps users navigate across the site

### Good homepage practices ###
_Showcase key information only_

*   Refrain from over-cluttering the homepage with information. Emphasise the subject with a short copy and keep longer details on a separate page instead.
*   The information available on the homepage should help users get to where they need.

_Customise your hero banner image_

Having a hero banner image that fits your website and copy can go a long way in how your website looks.

*   Use images that are engaging, relevant, and clear. Hero banner images should align with your organisation and the hero banner copy.
*   Avoid using low-quality images as they would be easily noticeable.
*   Hero banner images have a dark overlay by default to ensure proper contrast between text and background for optimal readability.

_Use more images_

*   Good use of images helps make your site easier to read as it breaks up and provides complimentary visual content for your texts.
*   Images used should be:
    *   Relevant to your content
    *   High-quality and not blurry
    *   Consistent across the page

_Use effective copywriting_

*   Create copies that are both functional and engaging to get your audience's attention. Make full use of your title texts to highlight key details or value propositions you want to convey.
*   Think about using more creative copies that relate to your brand/organisation. For example:
    *   About us –> OGP Approach
    *   Our values —> OGP Values

_Make full use of the homepage templates_

*   Fully utilise your homepage by using the different templates available to creatively convey information.
*   Infopics can be used to pair your information with effective images.

_Descriptive names for buttons and links_

*   Make buttons or text links more effective by using descriptive and unique names. For example, using “Learn More” or “Our Approach” rather than just “Click Here”.
*   This provides a relevant Call-to-Action while allowing users to better know what to expect when clicking on it.
*   Descriptive names are also important for those using screen readers, as they provide context describing where the link leads to.
