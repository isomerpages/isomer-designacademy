#### Basics of website planning #### 
To create an effective website, it is important to first plan on the type of content you need to have. This can be narrowed down to three main factors:

**Who is your main audience?**
* Is your website meant for current students, parents, or general audiences? Remember that different groups of people will want to look at different types of content.

**What is the objective of your website?**
   
* Identify the needs of your audience to keep website content concise and relevant. Take note of your website’s objectives compared to other platforms like social media.

**What do you want visitors to focus on?**
    
 * Once your website objective has been identified, think about how you can translate that into content on the website. Do note that having too much information would hinder users from what’s important.

#### Examples of well-planned websites
Take a look at [covid.gov.sg](http://covid.gov.sg) as an example. We can easily break down their website using the same framework:

*   **Audience** - People are suspected to have or have COVID-19
*   **Objective** - To inform the target audience on the steps they need to take according to their symptoms.
*   **Focus** - 4 key pages with specific information based on the person’s situation.

Another good example is the [Singapore Institute of Retail Studies’](https://www.sirs.edu.sg/) website:

*   **Audience** - People that might be interested in their programmes
*   **Objective** - To inform audiences about their services and provide related industry updates
*   **Focus** - Different programmes categories are featured at the top
