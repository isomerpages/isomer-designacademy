### Importance of text content design

Contrary to the homepage, Isomer’s other pages mainly handle text content using the markdown editor. The markdown editor allows users to format texts through elements like lists, headings, and bolding.

Although these pages largely handle texts, having well-structured text content is important as it heavily impacts the content readability and the overall user experience.

In general, text content on your website should be:

*   Well-organised
*   Easy to scan and read
*   Easy to understand
*   Accessible all users

### **Best practices for text content design**

**Proper use of headings**

*   Headings are used to organise webpages by segmenting texts into different sections. This allows users to easily scan the page and get to specific parts they need.
*   Headings rank from H1 to H5 in the markdown editor, in order of visual prominence and importance. H1 headings are often used to convey top-level ideas, followed by H2 level headings for their sub-sections. These sub-sections can then be further sectioned with H3 headings and so on.
*   It is a good practice to plan out your page’s overall content and heading structure first to keep your content organised.

**Write meaningful headings**

*   Headings should be relevant to the content. It should clearly describe the content in the following paragraph.
*   Headings should be understandable without context, which allows users to scan through the page and jump into sections they need to easily.

**Use of bulleted and numbered list**

*   The list is a useful element for breaking up chunks of text, shortening texts, and suggesting relationships between different items.
*   Take a look at both examples below. Having a list makes the content on the right more digestible.

*   Keep your lists neat by ensuring that items within them are similar in length.

**Break up content using paragraphs**

*   Use paragraphs to break up large chunks of text. This makes it easy for users to read and scan through information.
*   Keep your paragraphs short. Unlike printed content, paragraphs on the web should be much shorter.

**Write descriptive links**

*   Keep linked texts short but meaningful.
*   Make sure hyperlinked texts describe what the link is about. This helps users to know what to expect when clicking in.
*   Avoid general terms like “Click here” or “Read more”. Without context, such links would be confusing to users with screen readers.
