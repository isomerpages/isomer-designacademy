*This workshop was run twice on 7 Sep 2022 and 14 Sep 2022 with a total of 35 school representatives.*

**Why are we running this workshop?** The Isomer team would like to hear directly from schools about what is most important to you when designing and using a school website. Our end goal is always to help users build good websites, but in order to do that, we need to understand what makes a website good. In this session, participants can expect to:

- Learn about current challenges from parents and students when using school websites
- Ideate together on what makes a good school website
- Apply learnings to reimagine a school website landing page
